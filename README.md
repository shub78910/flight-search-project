This is a flight searching app. Basically, getting all the data from a JS object which I created to fetch the data.
The user can search the flights according to the destination.
As there was limited data, there are very few matches to the flights searched, and dates as well.

It has a slider filter as well to filter according to the prices.
After entering your destinations, hit the search the button, it has a loader feature as well.

I've kept the design minimum to focus on the funcitonality.
